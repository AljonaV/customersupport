# Customer Support
Your task today is to build the visual interface for a customer support service.

The data for the service can be fetched at https://kea-alt-del.dk/customersupport/

The endpoint provides one additional parameter you can work with if you like
| Parameter | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| count=10 | sets the amount of returned support requests |

All requests are generated randomly each time data is fetched
## Example
https://kea-alt-del.dk/customersupport/?count=10

### "Required tasks"
The following tasks are "required", meaning you should complete them unless you can come up with better solution than my suggestion
